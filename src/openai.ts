Append after each Section title the % of items in that section. If there's nothing in a section don't put it in the result. Remove words like fix, style, chore, refactor from the front of the items, and just put a section head and group the items in each section.
    
The format I would like is...
emoji Feature (20%):
- Feature 1 description
- Feature 2 description
- etc...` + '\n\n-----\n\n' + log;

Here are the guidelines to follow.
- Break down logs provided below into set of sub-lists broken into feature, fix, chore, refactor, and docs.
- Use üêõ for fix, üì¶ for chore, üî®for refactor, ‚ú® for feature, and üìù for docs. Append after each Section title the % of items in that section. Group sections with the same title.
- If there is nothing in a section don't put it in the result. 
- If there is nothing to summarize, do not respond with anything.
- If there is a version number, do not try to make up version details from your own knowledge.
- Ignore versions, just focus on the logs.
  
Here are the logs:
  
${log}`;
      break;
    default:
      fullPrompt = `You are a helpful assistant. Your audience is the product team. You are tasked to generate a summary based on the content provided.`;
